# SpotiFLAC Python Module

Fetch Spotify track metadata and retrieve matching lossless audio through Tidal, Qobuz, Amazon Music and other provider backends — supplied entirely via extensions you choose and configure yourself. Integrate directly into your Python projects, build custom Telegram bots, automation tools, or bulk downloaders.

## Why the module (instead of the standalone apps)

The Desktop and Mobile apps are built for direct, immediate use: open it, paste a link, download. The Python module exists for a different case — **integrating** this logic into something else.

It makes sense to start here if:

- **You're building a bot** (Telegram, Discord) or a service that needs to handle requests from many users automatically, not a single manual download.
- **You need the async API** (`AsyncSpotiFLAC`) inside an existing FastAPI/Quart/Sanic app, with shared connection pooling.
- **You want to orchestrate bulk downloads** via scripts — multiple playlists, full discographies, local library retagging — with custom logic (filenames via a Python function, post-download actions, saved profiles).
- **You need to run headless**, on a server, a NAS, or inside Docker, possibly as part of a larger pipeline.
- **You want full control over which extensions get loaded** and from which registry, instead of relying on a fixed set baked into an app.

If you just want a GUI for personal use, with no code involved, the [Desktop](https://github.com/afkarxyz/SpotiFLAC) or [Mobile](https://github.com/zarzet/SpotiFLAC-Mobile) apps remain the simpler choice — this module is the building block those (and similar projects) can be built on top of.

## Features

- Native synchronous and asynchronous Python APIs
- Modular JavaScript and Python Extension system (bring-your-own registry — nothing bundled)
- Automatic fallback among the extensions *you* have installed
- Built-in GUI, as a native window or served locally in a browser (`--gui` / `--web`)
- Interactive CLI Wizard
- Docker support
- Configuration Profiles
- MusicBrainz metadata enrichment
- Embedded synchronized lyrics
- Optional MP3 320 kbps transcoding
- Watch mode: re-sync a playlist/album/artist/URL on an interval, indefinitely
- Optional shared-secret or per-account authentication for `--web`, plus a queued, per-user download history in multi-user mode
- Extension discovery directories, and optional Ed25519 signature verification on top of registry checksums
- Local-library duplicate detection by acoustic fingerprint, independent of tags/ISRC
- Extension scaffolding + dry-run validation for developing your own
- Installable as a PWA in `--web` mode (Add to Home Screen / standalone window)
- **Follow artists** — check for new releases and fetch only what came out since
- **Library upgrade** — find files below a target quality (including fake Hi-Res) and re-fetch them
- **Outbound notifications** — webhook, Discord, Telegram or ntfy, per track or one summary per run
- **Versioned REST API** at `/api/v1`, with an OpenAPI document at `/docs`
- **Durable queue and download log** (SQLite): a restart no longer loses queued work
- **Per-account quotas and an admin role** in `--web-multiuser`
- **Extension health panel** — success rate, latency and last error per provider

## Installation

```bash
pip install SpotiFLAC
```

> **Important:** out of the box, SpotiFLAC does nothing but resolve Spotify metadata — it ships with **no built-in provider and no default extension source**. Before you can download anything, you need to point it at an extension registry of your own choosing and install at least one extension. See [Extensions](docs/guide/extensions.md#extensions) below.

## Documentation

The full guide lives in [`docs/guide/`](docs/guide/) — the README had grown
to 76 KB and 87 headings, which is past the point where GitHub or PyPI
renders it usefully. Every page below is the same text that used to be here.

| Page | What's in it |
| --- | --- |
| [Quick Start](docs/guide/quick-start.md) | Every way to run it — GUI, web, CLI, interactive wizard, Python — and the URL types it accepts |
| [Extensions](docs/guide/extensions.md) | Registries, installing providers, signature verification and trust tiers |
| [Configuration](docs/guide/configuration.md) | Every option: naming, quality, lyrics, enrichment, transcoding, watch mode, profiles |
| [API Reference](docs/guide/api-reference.md) | `SpotiFLAC` and `AsyncSpotiFLAC`, and the objects they return |
| [Local Tagging](docs/guide/local-tagging.md) | Retagging an existing library, MusicBrainz enrichment, download validation |
| [Automation & Operations](docs/guide/automation.md) | JSON output, post-download hooks, notifications, M3U, library rescan, cache maintenance, running the web server |
| [Following Artists](docs/guide/subscriptions.md) | Subscriptions, new-release checks, and the library-upgrade pass |
| [REST API](docs/guide/rest-api.md) | The versioned `/api/v1` surface, quotas and the admin endpoints |
| [Docker](docs/guide/docker.md) | Headless and NAS setups |
| [CLI](docs/guide/cli.md) | The standalone executables |
