"""A set DISPLAY is not a running X server.

The `--web` container never started Xvfb — its entrypoint skips the display
setup for web mode — while the image sets `DISPLAY=:99` for every mode. The
bootstrap read the variable, concluded a display existed and returned, so
every Turnstile solve spent Chromium's full 45s start timeout reaching for a
display nobody had started, and reported `FailedToStartBrowser` next to
`binary_exists=True`.
