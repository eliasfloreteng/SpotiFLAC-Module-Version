"""The persistent Monochrome browser is closed when the run ends.

The Amazon provider's mono path (amz.geeked.wtf) keeps a real Chrome alive
between tracks on purpose — the JWT it gets is tied to that browser's TLS
session. What it must not do is keep it alive between *runs*: the session is
a module-level singleton rather than a provider, so `_close_providers()` did
not reach it and the only thing that ever shut it down was the process
exiting. The CLI exits after a run and got away with it; the TUI and the
desktop window stay up, and Chrome sat there after the download finished.

Closed once per batch, too: hanging it off DownloadWorker.run_async meant a
command naming three albums restarted the browser twice mid-run, and each
restart is a Turnstile solve.
