"""Guards the politeness of the playcount column.

Playcounts have no bulk query — it is one request per track against
Spotify's internal GraphQL API, and a CSV import can mean thousands of
them. SpotifyWebClient.query() has no 429 handling of its own, so the two
things that keep that from becoming a burst are the interval in
_fetch_track_playcounts() and the pause while a download is running. Both
are easy to drop by accident when that method is next touched, and neither
fails loudly when it goes: the requests just get faster.
