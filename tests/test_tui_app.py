"""The TUI, driven headless.

Textual's `run_test()` runs the real app against an off-screen terminal, so
these are not "does it import" tests: the widgets are mounted, the CSS is
parsed, and the bindings fire. That matters most for the parts that are easy
to get subtly wrong and impossible to notice from a unit test — a stylesheet
that fails to parse, a widget id the panel queries but never mounts, a
`Select` handed a value that is not among its options.
