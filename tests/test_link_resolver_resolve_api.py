"""Cross-platform links have to come from something that answers.

Odesli retired free public access to Songlink's v1-alpha.1 API, and every
request now returns 401 PUBLIC_API_ACCESS_DEPRECATED — measured directly,
with and without our own headers, for both the `url` and `isrc` forms. The
resolver kept asking it and kept getting nothing, silently: callers just saw
an empty link map.

The mobile app already routes Spotify URLs through a resolve endpoint on the
project's own infrastructure and uses Songlink only as a fallback. These
tests pin that order down, and pin down the response shapes the endpoint
actually returns — its values are sometimes a bare URL string and sometimes
an object wrapping one.
