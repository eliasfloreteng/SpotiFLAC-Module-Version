"""Three things a long run has to be able to say about itself.

A CSV import and an extension download are both minutes of work behind a
single line of output, and each of them used to under-report in its own way:

  - matching a CSV said "Matching them…" once and nothing again until it
    finished, so a file whose columns were wrong looked identical to one
    that was working;
  - a JS extension's download reported a *percentage* through a callback
    whose contract is byte counts, so the bar filled to "97B / 100B" for a
    30 MB FLAC and the speed was computed from percent-per-second;
  - the ticket step — a whole authenticated round trip that a stalled
    download is usually stuck in — was invisible unless it raised.
