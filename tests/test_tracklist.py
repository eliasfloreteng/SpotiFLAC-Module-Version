"""`core/tracklist.py` — a link, the tracks behind it, and which to fetch.

The interesting decision is `download_target()`. Selecting everything must
hand back the *collection* URL, not a list of track links: the collection
resolves once and keeps the album's own ordering and numbering, where a list
of individual tracks is exactly that. Getting it backwards would still
download the right audio and quietly file it wrong.
