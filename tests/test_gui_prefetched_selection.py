"""Tracks picked in the GUI must not be looked up again one by one.

The GUI fetched the whole list to show it, but a partial selection reached the
downloader as bare links, and _resolve_track_list_async() resolved each one
with a full metadata lookup — several requests a track. The GUI now hands over
the metadata it already has. Of what such a lookup used to bring along, the
disc number is read from the native metadata the ISRC lookup caches, and the
composer — which that metadata does not carry — costs one credits request.
