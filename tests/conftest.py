"""Shared test setup.

The suite was reaching the network and installing real extensions. Any test
that builds the `--web` app runs its lifespan, which constructs an
`ExtensionManager` with `auto_install_downloads=True`; that reads whatever
registries the developer happens to have in `.env` or the environment,
downloads whatever they list, and unpacks it into `~/.spotiflac/extensions`.

So the suite was slow, dependent on someone else's server being up, and
capable of modifying the machine it ran on — and its results depended on
the developer's own configuration, which is the opposite of what a test
suite is for.
