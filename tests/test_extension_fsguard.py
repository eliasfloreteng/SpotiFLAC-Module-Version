"""Extensions must not be able to write wherever they like.

Extensions are third-party JavaScript running with the user's own
permissions. Nothing stopped one writing to a shell profile, to
~/.ssh/authorized_keys, or — most pointedly — to
~/.spotiflac/trusted_keys.json, the Ed25519 root of trust that decides
which registry entries count as signed. An extension that can add a key
there can sign its own successors, defeating the signing scheme entirely.

A provider needs three places: the file it was asked to produce, its own
directory, and a temp directory. These tests pin that boundary down with
the real preload under the real Node, and cover two details that a
plausible-looking implementation gets wrong:

  - macOS resolves os.tmpdir() to /private/var/..., so an allow-list that
    is not itself realpath-ed rejects the very temp directory it permits;
  - the extension runs inside a worker_threads Worker, not the main
    thread, so a preload that did not reach workers would protect nothing.
