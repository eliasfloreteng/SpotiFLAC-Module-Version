"""The GUI must download a selection as one run, not one run per track.

A hand-picked selection cannot be expressed as a collection URL, so
_download_task built a list of track links — and then called
client.SpotiFLAC() once per link. Each call is a one-shot session (its own
event loop, httpx pool, ExtensionManager and provider set), so the console
showed a full "[RUN] 1 track(s)" pipeline per track, the provider bootstrap
ran again for every one of them, and max_concurrent_downloads had nothing to
work with: a pool holding one track has nothing to download beside it.
