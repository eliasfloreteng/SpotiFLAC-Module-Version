"""Picking tracks in the TUI, and the run honouring the pick.

The panel itself is a table with a tick column; the part worth guarding is
the seam behind it. A selection that looks right on screen and does not reach
`_run_download_async` is the failure nobody would notice until the wrong
files landed on disk, so the last test here follows the pick all the way into
the `cfg` the launcher is handed.
