"""Two downloads must not write the same file at once.

The output filename comes from the metadata, so identical metadata gives an
identical name: a playlist that lists a track twice, an album queued
alongside the single it came from, the same track picked from two sources.
Nothing stopped those writing concurrently — both stream into the same
`.part` and rename over the same destination, and what survives is a file
that looks complete and may be two downloads interleaved.

Serialising per path rather than globally is the whole point, so the test
that unrelated paths still run in parallel matters as much as the one that
a collision waits.
