"""A candidate has to agree about the *title*, not just the artist.

score_track_match() weighed the title at 0.6 and the artist at 0.4, and a
corroborating running time added 0.05 on top. That gave any track by the
right artist a floor of 0.45 before its title was considered at all — and
letter overlap between two unrelated Italian titles is worth enough on top
of that to clear an accept threshold.

Measured: iTunes does not carry Sfera Ebbasta's "Bottiglie Privè", so a
search for it answered with "Visiera A Becco" — a different song, from an
album four years earlier, running 1.4s away from the right length. It
scored 0.666 against a 0.55 threshold, and the downloaded file was tagged
with that album's cover art instead of "Famoso"'s.
