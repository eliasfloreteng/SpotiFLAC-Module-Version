"""tools/library_upgrade_cli.py — the `--upgrade-library` command.

Reporting and argument handling only; every decision about what counts as
upgradable lives in core/library_upgrade.py, and the fetching is the ordinary
download path. Same split as tools/hires_check_cli.py.

The default is a dry run. An upgrade re-downloads files and (with
`--replace`) overwrites what is already on disk, which is not something a
command should do because you were curious what it would find.
