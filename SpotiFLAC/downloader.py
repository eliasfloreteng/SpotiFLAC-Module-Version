"""Downloader — main orchestrator (100% Async Native).
Changes compared to the original:
  - DownloadOptions: +track_max_retries, +post_download_action, +post_download_command
  - download_one_async(): per-track retry with exponential backoff and pure async flow
  - DownloadWorker.run_async(): async semaphores for concurrent task orchestration
  - SpotiflacDownloader.run_async(): fully async batch processing and metadata fetching
  - 100% Asynchronous I/O wrappers for filesystem operations.

    The Amazon provider's mono path (amz.geeked.wtf) keeps a real Chrome
    alive on purpose: the JWT it gets back is tied to that browser's TLS
    session, so closing it between tracks would cost a Turnstile solve every
    time. Between *batches* there is nothing left to keep.

    It was never being closed at all, once. The session is a module-level
    singleton in `core.signed_session_mono` rather than a provider object, so
    `DownloadWorker._close_providers()` never saw it, and the only thing that
    ever shut it down was the `atexit` hook — i.e. the process exiting. The
    CLI exits after a run and got away with it; the TUI and the desktop
    window do not, so Chrome stayed on screen after the download finished.

    Called per batch, not per worker. It lived in `DownloadWorker.run_async`,
    which runs once per *collection*: three albums in one command therefore
    tore the browser down and stood it back up twice mid-run, paying a
    Turnstile solve each time — the exact cost the shared session exists to
    avoid. The batch entry points own it now.

    Read out of `sys.modules` rather than imported: `signed_session_mono`
    pulls in pydoll, and importing it here to ask whether a browser needs
    closing would load it for every run that never went near Amazon. If the
    module was never imported, no mono browser was ever started and there is
    nothing to close.

    Bounded and suppressed because a browser that will not close is not a
    reason to fail a download that already succeeded — and
    `close_mono_browser_session()` falls back to killing by profile directory

        Before: a list of asyncio.Task consumed with asyncio.as_completed().
        Functionally correct, but without structured error propagation
        (a task raising an unexpected exception did not cancel the others,
        and cancellation had to be handled manually).

        Now: asyncio.TaskGroup (structured concurrency, PEP 654/3.11+).
        Rate limiting remains an asyncio.Semaphore(max_concurrent_downloads)
        acquired by each worker before performing heavy I/O (network requests /
        disk writes). Results are processed as they arrive through an internal
        asyncio.Queue, so progress bar updates remain incremental like the
        as_completed version, but inside a TaskGroup that ensures: if a worker
        raises an unexpected exception, all other tasks in the group are
        cleanly cancelled instead of continuing.

        run_async() reads a list as a list of collections: one
        _run_once_async() per URL, each with its own metadata fetch, its own
        DownloadWorker and its own summary. That is right for two playlists
        and wrong for twenty tracks picked out of one — the GUI's case, where
        a partial selection cannot be expressed as a collection URL (see

        pipeline of its own and max_concurrent_downloads meant nothing: a
        pool holding one track has nothing to run beside it.

        go through a single worker: one [RUN] header, one progress bar, one
        summary, one queue for the GUI to read its stats off — and the
        semaphore finally doing what it is set to.

        as the individual tracks they are (is_album/is_playlist False),

        no files. The one visible difference is the numeric prefix under

        so a selection of twenty came out as twenty files all numbered 01;
        numbered as one batch they count 1..N in the order selected, which is
