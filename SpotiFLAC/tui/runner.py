"""runner.py — Running a download while something else owns the screen.

Three things have to happen at once for the TUI to show a live download, and
each of them already exists somewhere in the codebase; this module is the
wiring, not the machinery.

* **Nothing may reach the terminal.** The output sink from `core.output_sink`
  takes every console line, every `safe_print`, and — via a
  `CallbackLogHandler` — every log record, and hands them here instead.
  Progress bars switch themselves off as a side effect of the sink being
  installed, so no tqdm ever draws over the layout.
* **Progress has to arrive as data.** `DownloadBroadcaster` already emits
  structured dicts for the GUI; the TUI subscribes to the same queue. No
  parsing of bar output, which is the thing that usually makes a terminal UI
  over an existing CLI unpleasant.
* **The run itself is unchanged.** `launcher.run_download_from_cfg` is the
  same call the wizard makes, with the same dict.

Everything crossing back into the UI goes through one asyncio queue, filled
with `call_soon_threadsafe`. Parts of a download legitimately run in worker
threads (`asyncio.to_thread` around blocking provider code), so a callback
that touched a widget directly would eventually do it from the wrong thread —
rarely, and only under load, which is the worst way to find out.
