"""help_screen.py — What the keys do, without leaving the screen.

The footer shows the handful of bindings there is room for; this is the rest,
plus the two things a first-time user actually needs told — that settings go
grey when something else has decided them, and that the Command panel is how
you graduate to the CLI.

Deliberately a modal rather than a panel: help you have to navigate *to* is
help you look for somewhere else instead.

Settings that are greyed out are not broken — something else has already \

are alternatives, not both.

The Command panel shows the equivalent `spotiflac ...` invocation, updated as \
you type. Once a configuration is one you run often, copy it into a script \
and stop opening this.\
