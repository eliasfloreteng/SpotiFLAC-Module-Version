"""config_state.py — Everything `--tui` needs to ask, as state rather than steps.

The wizard this replaced was a sequence: ask a question, branch on the
answer, ask the next one. That shape is why answering it took fifteen screens
and why going back meant starting over — and it is the reason a straight port
would have been the wrong move. Here the same ~40 settings are
one dataclass that is always complete and always valid, and the screen is a
view onto it: change a field and every dependent field settles at once, in
any order, as many times as you like.

The dependencies the wizard expressed by *not asking* a question live in
:meth:`ConfigState.normalized` instead — track numbers still turn off the
subfolder options, "no lyrics" still clears the `.lrc` settings — so a UI
that shows every control at once cannot produce a combination the wizard
could not.

:meth:`ConfigState.to_cfg` produces the dict `launcher.amain()` spreads over
`_run_download_async`, key for key. That contract is the whole point of the
module, and `tests/test_tui_config_state.py` pins it against what the
launcher actually reads, so a new download flag cannot be wired into the CLI
and quietly skipped here.
