"""banner.py — The wordmark at the top, and the key hints at the bottom.

MovieBox opens on a centred block-letter wordmark with a version line under
it, and closes every screen with a row of ``[key] action`` hints. Those two
bands are most of what makes it recognisable before you have read a word of
it, so they are widgets here rather than decoration sprinkled into the app.

Both resize themselves. The wordmark drops from six rows of letterform to
two, and then to a word, as the terminal narrows or shortens — a logo that
eats a quarter of a short screen is a logo in the way. The hint bar drops
hints from the right, keeping the ones you cannot work without.
