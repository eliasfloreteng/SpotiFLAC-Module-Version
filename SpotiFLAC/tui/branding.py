"""branding.py — The TUI's visual vocabulary, in one place.

The look is modelled on MovieBox-Tui (Rust + Ratatui), which the plan names
as the reference. Four things carry that identity, and they are all here so
that no panel has to reinvent one of them:

* **The wordmark** — a centred ANSI-Shadow block letterform, with a two-row
  fallback for narrow terminals and a plain one for terminals that can draw
  neither.
* **Decorated panel titles** — ``─ ✦  Providers`` on the left, an accent tag
  like ``[ /browse ]`` on the right. It is the single cheapest thing that
  makes a bordered box read as designed rather than as a default.
* **Badges** — a short label on a solid colour, the way a resolution is shown
  in MovieBox. Here they carry audio quality and per-track outcome.
* **Key hints** — ``[Ctrl+R] Run``, dim, along the bottom.

Everything degrades. `plain_terminal()` answers the question MovieBox calls
`basic_terminal`, and every helper takes the answer into account: box glyphs
become ASCII, filled badges become bracketed text, the wordmark becomes a
word. A terminal that cannot draw this should still be usable, not decorated
badly.
