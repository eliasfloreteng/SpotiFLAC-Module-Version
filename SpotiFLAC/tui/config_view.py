"""config_view.py — The wizard's fifteen questions as one editable screen.

Every control here is bound to a field of :class:`ConfigState` by its `id`:
a widget with `id="cfg-output_dir"` writes to `state.output_dir` and nothing
else. That is the whole binding layer, and it is deliberately dumb — the
rules about which settings cancel which live in `ConfigState.normalized()`,
so a control cannot enforce a rule the produced `cfg` would then contradict.

What the widgets *do* own is whether a question is worth showing: a bitrate
for a lossless target, or an artist separator when only the first artist is
kept, are settings with no effect, and the panel disables them rather than
inviting an answer it will discard.

One difference from the wizard worth naming: quality is offered as the six
canonical tiers rather than a provider-specific menu. The wizard could ask a
narrower question because it already knew which providers had been picked;
a screen where both are editable at once cannot, and `allow_fallback` —
which is on by default — is what covers a tier a provider will not serve.
