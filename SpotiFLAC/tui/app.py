"""app.py — `spotiflac --tui`.

The guided mode, as one screen instead of fifteen questions. A sidebar picks
what the main panel shows; the panels themselves are small, because each one
sits on top of something the project already had:

* **Download** edits a `ConfigState`, which produces the same `cfg` dict the
  wizard produced (`config_view.py`, `config_state.py`).
* **Queue** renders `DownloadBroadcaster` events, the channel the GUI has
  consumed all along (`queue_view.py`).
* **Command** is the equivalent `spotiflac …` invocation, rebuilt on every
  keystroke — the wizard printed this once at the end, and the point of it
  was always to teach the CLI (`core/cli_preview.py`).

Nothing here imports `SpotiFLAC.app`: that module imports pywebview at module
level and its API object is synchronous and thread-based. The TUI talks to
`core/*` and `extensions/*` directly.

The log pane at the bottom is where the run's console output goes — not
because a UI needs a log, but because during a download there is nowhere else
for it to be. `core.output_sink` makes that possible; without it every one of
those lines would land on the terminal underneath and tear the layout.
