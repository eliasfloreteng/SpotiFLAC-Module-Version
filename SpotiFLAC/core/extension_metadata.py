"""extension_metadata.py — Catalogues that only an extension can read.

Melon, Bugs and Genie have no public API. What they have is extensions,
written for the mobile app, that scrape them and answer as a
`metadata_provider`: `searchTracks`, `getTrack`, `getAlbum`, `getPlaylist`.
Those extensions installed fine here and then were never asked anything —
nothing in this app routed a link or a search to a metadata provider.

This module is that routing:

* a link on one of the sites below is handed to whichever installed
  extension declares network access to that site, and its answer becomes
  `TrackMetadata` like any other provider's;
* a search can be sent to the same extension instead of Spotify;
* each track is matched to Spotify by title and artist to learn its ISRC,
  because these catalogues rarely publish one and the download services find
  a recording by ISRC. Tags keep the catalogue's own names — a Korean title
  stays in Hangul — only the identifier is borrowed.

The extensions carry no URL handling of their own, so the link shapes are
listed here, one entry per site. The extension is found by the hosts in its
manifest's `permissions.network`, not by its id: a fork or a renamed
extension for the same site works without a change here.
