"""core/subscription_scheduler.py — checking subscriptions on their own timer.

A subscription with `interval_minutes` > 0 is checked whenever that much time
has passed since its last check (see subscriptions.due()); what the check
finds new is downloaded. This module is only the clock: *what* a check does —
list, compare, queue the downloads — is the `run_check` callable it is given,
which the GUI (app.py) and the web server (webapp.py) wire to the Api
instance that owns the subscription. So the timing is testable without a
network, a provider or a window.

One thread, one subscription at a time. Checks are several Spotify calls
each, and running them side by side is how an instance gets rate-limited;
the downloads they queue run on the ordinary download path either way.
