"""core/stats.py — the download log, read back as a picture of a library.

`core/download_log.py` writes one row per finished track because three
features needed to *look one track up*: quotas count, subscriptions check,
deduplication asks "have I got this?". None of them ever read the table as a
whole.

Read as a whole, the same rows answer a different kind of question — the one
people actually ask about their own library. How much of it is there. Which
artists it is really made of, as opposed to which ones you would have named.
Which genres, which decades. When you do this: the month you went on a spree,
the hour of the day, the longest run of consecutive days. That is what this
module computes, and it is deliberately all it does: no formatting decisions
beyond `format_wrapped` for the CLI, no HTTP, no filesystem.

Everything comes from one query
-------------------------------
Aggregating in SQL would mean five round trips and still couldn't do the two
that matter most: `artist` holds "A, B" and `genre` holds "Rock; Alternative",
and splitting a string is not something SQLite does. So one `SELECT` over the
window feeds `collections.Counter`, which for a personal library — tens of
thousands of rows at the very outside — is a few tens of milliseconds and a
few megabytes.

What "unknown" means
--------------------
Genre, release year and duration arrived with schema v2 (see core/db.py).
Rows written before it have none, and rows written since only have a genre if
metadata enrichment was on. Every section that depends on them reports its
own coverage (`known` / `unknown`) rather than quietly presenting a fifth of
the library as all of it — a dashboard that overstates what it knows is worse
than one that admits a gap.
