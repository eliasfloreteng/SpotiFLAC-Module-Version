"""Acoustic-fingerprint duplicate detection for the local library tools.

Local Tagging's existing dedup (see local_matcher.py / playlist_sync.py)
matches by ISRC or by normalized title+artist text. Both are cheap and
usually right, but neither looks at the audio itself: a re-rip with wrong
or missing tags, or the same recording from two providers with slightly
different metadata, can slip through as "not a duplicate" when it plainly
is one to a human ear.

This module adds a second, independent signal — Chromaprint acoustic
fingerprints (via the optional `pyacoustid` package, itself a thin wrapper
around the `fpcalc` binary from https://acoustid.org/chromaprint) — for
callers who want to catch those. It never talks to the network or the
AcoustID lookup service; everything here is a purely local, fingerprint-to-
fingerprint comparison, so it needs no API key and sends no data anywhere.

Public API:
    - is_available() -> bool
    - compute_fingerprint(path) -> AudioFingerprint      (sync, blocking)
    - compute_fingerprint_async(path) -> AudioFingerprint (off-thread)
    - fingerprint_similarity(a, b) -> float               (0.0-1.0)
    - find_duplicate_groups(fingerprints, ...) -> list[list[Path]]

Off by default and fully opt-in, same posture as core/hires_check.py:
requires `pip install SpotiFLAC[dedup]` (pyacoustid + the system `fpcalc`
binary); if either is missing, is_available() is False and callers are
expected to skip the feature rather than fail.
