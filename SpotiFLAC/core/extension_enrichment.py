"""extension_enrichment.py — The extensions' own metadata, for tagging.

Every JavaScript download extension (tidal-web, qobuz-web, deezer) and the
apple-music metadata extension answers `enrichTrack`: given a title, artist,
ISRC and running time, it finds the track on its service and returns what
that service knows — label, ℗ line, composers, UPC, the release's totals,
its credits. The app never asked. Enrichment went only to the built-in
Python lookups, which for Tidal returned nothing at all and for Apple only
what the public iTunes search carries.

So enrichment now asks both. Each service in the enrichment list gets its
built-in lookup (which uses the Python extensions where it needs a
service's API) and then its own JavaScript extensions; after those, every
other installed JavaScript extension that implements enrichTrack is asked
too — always, whether or not its service is in the list. Each fills only
the fields still blank.

Two things keep that from costing more than it gives:

* the extensions run in Node, and starting a runtime takes seconds; the
  providers here are kept alive and reused across tracks, so only the first
  track of a run pays for it;
* an extension's answer is checked before it is believed — the title (and
  ISRC, where both have one) must be the same recording, and the
  release-scoped fields (label, UPC, date, totals, cover) are taken only
  when the album agrees, the same rule Deezer's lookup already follows.

$SPOTIFLAC_ENRICH_EXTENSIONS=0 turns the extension half off.
