"""core/csv_source.py — a CSV file as an input source.

Every existing entry point takes a *link*: a track, an album, a playlist, an
artist. That covers what a streaming service can hand over, and misses what
people actually have lying around — the export of a playlist they no longer
have access to, a spreadsheet of records to buy, the CSV a DJ tool or a
"transfer my library" service produced. Those are lists of *tracks*, usually
without a single usable URL in them.

This module turns such a file into something the downloader already knows how
to consume: a list of URLs.

Two halves, deliberately separate
---------------------------------
`read_rows()` is pure parsing — no network, no Spotify, no downloader. It
sniffs the delimiter, works out which columns mean what (by header name, or
by looking at the values when there is no header) and yields `CsvRow`s. It is
the part with all the awkward real-world cases in it, and the part worth
testing exhaustively.

`resolve_rows()` is the network half: rows that already carry a link keep it,
rows that carry only text are matched against Spotify's catalogue and scored,
and anything that doesn't match well enough is *reported* rather than guessed
at. A wrong match here means a file on disk with the right name and the wrong
music in it, which is worse than a row the user is told about and can fix.

Supported shapes
----------------
Anything with a header naming the usual columns works, which covers the
common exporters:

    Exportify / Spotify playlist exports
        "Track URI","Track Name","Artist Name(s)","Album Name","ISRC","Duration (ms)"
    Soundiiz / TuneMyMusic style
        "Title","Artist","Album","ISRC"
    a bare list of links
        one URL per line, with or without a header

The column names are matched case-insensitively and ignoring punctuation, so
"Track Name", "track_name" and "TRACKNAME" are the same column.

    identity lookup: either the ISRC is known and the answer is the right
    recording, or it isn't and the row is reported.

    Spotify's own catalogue is asked first, through the `isrc:` search

    the v1-alpha.1 API. The effect was silent: a row identified only by its
    ISRC, which is the one kind of row that could have been matched with
    certainty, came back as "ISRC not found".

    The resolver is still tried afterwards, so an injected or future working
    one is used rather than ignored.
