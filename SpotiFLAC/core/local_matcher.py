"""SpotiFLAC/core/local_matcher.py — Phase 2: Match Engine.

Connects a locally-scanned file (local_scanner.LocalFileInfo) to a proper
TrackMetadata match, by reusing SpotifyMetadataClient.search() — the exact
same search engine already used by the GUI's search tab (see
app.py:search_provider) — rather than building a second one.

Two things decide a match here, in order of how much they can be trusted:

1. The file's own ISRC, when it has one. An ISRC names a specific recording,
   so this is an identity check rather than a guess — no amount of string
   similarity beats it, and files that were themselves bought or downloaded
   from a store usually carry one.
2. Otherwise, text similarity scored by core/text_match.py, the same scorer
   the CSV importer uses. This module used to carry its own, which glued
   "artist title" into a single string and compared that; see text_match's
   docstring for the two ways that misfires and why it was replaced.
