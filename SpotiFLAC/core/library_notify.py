"""Telling a music server that new files arrived.

The Docker/NAS case the project already serves — a headless instance
downloading into a folder something else indexes — has one missing step at
the end: the library server doesn't know anything changed until its own
scheduled scan comes round, which can be hours.

Every one of the three servers below exposes a "rescan now" call. What
differs is only the URL shape and how the credential travels, so this is a
small amount of per-server knowledge and one shared caller.

Credentials
-----------
Tokens come from `--library-token` or `$SPOTIFLAC_LIBRARY_TOKEN`, never from
the config a GUI/web request can supply: the same reasoning as the
post-download shell command (see app.py's POST_COMMAND_ENV). A rescan is
harmless, but the token is not, and a request must not get to choose which
host it is sent to.

    On the MD5
    ----------
    Static analysis flags this, and it is right that MD5 is weak. It is also
    not a choice available to us: the Subsonic API *specifies* this exact
    construction, and the server computes the same digest to compare. Using
    PBKDF2 or bcrypt here would simply fail to authenticate.

    The alternatives the protocol offers are worse:

      - `p=<password>` — the plaintext password, in the query string, and
        therefore in the server's access log.
      - `p=enc:<hex>` — hex-encoded plaintext, which is the same thing.

    So this is the strongest of the three options a Subsonic server accepts,
    not a preference. What it *does* mean, and what the caller should know:
    the digest is offline-crackable for a weak password, so use a dedicated
    account for SpotiFLAC rather than one whose password you reuse, and
    reach the server over HTTPS (see _warn_if_cleartext, which says so
    when you don't).

    If this alert is triaged again: it is accurate about MD5 and wrong about
    the remedy. Dismiss it as "won't fix" against this docstring, or drop
    Subsonic support — those are the two real options.
