"""csv_picker.py — Finding the track list someone meant.

A CSV is the other kind of input SpotiFLAC takes: a list of tracks instead of
a link to one. Naming the file is the awkward part — the path is long, it was
exported five minutes ago into whichever folder the browser uses, and typing
it out is the step people get wrong.

So this module answers two questions and leaves the asking to whoever owns
the screen: *what did they actually type* (`clean_path_input`, which has to
survive a path dragged in from a shell, quotes and escapes and all), and
*what is lying around that looks like a track list* (`scan_csv_files` over
`csv_scan_dirs`).

None of it prints. It started inside the old interactive wizard, where it
did, and moved here so the terminal UI could offer the same picker without
inheriting a wizard's idea of how to draw one.

    The unescaping is POSIX-only on purpose: on Windows the backslash is the
    path separator, and running ``C:\\Users\\me\\list.csv`` through `shlex`
