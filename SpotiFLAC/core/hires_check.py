"""Hi-Res authenticity checker.

Detects "fake hi-res" audio files. A file can claim Hi-Res along two
independent axes, and each is checked on its own terms:

  Sample rate — it declares 96 kHz but its spectral content stops at, or
    just above, the ~22.05 kHz Nyquist limit of a 44.1 kHz source. That
    sharp cutoff is the fingerprint of upsampling: taking a CD-quality or
    lossy source and re-encoding it at a higher rate without adding any
    real high-frequency content. Measuring it is a heuristic.

  Bit depth — it declares 24-bit but only 16 of those bits ever carry
    data, the low 8 being zero in every single sample. That is a CD master
    padded out to look deeper, and unlike the spectral test this one is
    exact: bits are either used or they are not. It is also the only test
    that says anything about a 24-bit/44.1 kHz file, which claims Hi-Res
    purely by depth and which the spectral test cannot judge at all.

The cutoff alone cannot tell the two ways a spectrum ends at 22 kHz apart:
an upsampled CD, and a genuine hi-res master that was deliberately low-pass
filtered during mastering. Above 22 kHz they are the same signal. So every
"fake_hires" verdict is graded by evidence that can separate them, and that
answers the question that actually matters before replacing a file: would a
LOSSLESS copy lose anything this one holds?

  certain — an exact fingerprint: padded bit depth, every sample repeated
    (sample-and-hold), in-between samples on a straight line (linear
    interpolation), or the band above 22 kHz mirroring the audible one
    (imaging).
  likely  — a resampler's cliff right at 22.05/24 kHz (flat passband, then
    40+ dB down within a few kHz), over an in-band noise floor no lower
    than 16-bit quantization noise: nothing in the file exceeds what a
    16-bit LOSSLESS copy holds.
  suspect — anything else that fails the cutoff test: a gradual roll-off,
    a floor below the 16-bit level (real resolution a 16-bit copy would
    lose), or a floor the music never leaves quiet enough to read. It may
    be a genuine master and is never replaced automatically
    (`redownload_safe` is False).

This is kept in lockstep with SpotiFLAC-Mobile's go_backend/hires_check.go
and hires_check_evidence.go: same thresholds, same verdicts.

        sample_seconds: Length, in seconds, of the segment to analyze.
            Clamped to the file's actual duration if shorter.
        noise_floor_db: dB threshold (relative to the segment's peak)
            above which a frequency bin is considered "active" content
            rather than noise/silence.

            (Hz) a genuine Hi-Res file is expected to reach. Sits well
            above 22.05 kHz on purpose: a resampler upsampling from CD
            leaves a transition-band tail a couple of kHz wide, which a
            threshold hugging the CD Nyquist reads as real content. A
            measured 44.1 -> 176.4 kHz upsample of a commercial track
            reached ~24.7 kHz — the old 24 kHz default passed it.
        n_fft: FFT window size for the STFT. Automatically shrunk for very
            short segments, so a window longer than the audio cannot end up
            measuring its own zero padding.

    Returns:
        A populated HiResCheckResult. Never returns partial/garbage data —
        any failure raises HiResCheckError instead.
