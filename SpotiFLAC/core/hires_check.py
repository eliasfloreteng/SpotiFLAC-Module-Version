"""Hi-Res authenticity checker.

Detects "fake hi-res" audio files. A file can claim Hi-Res along two
independent axes, and each is checked on its own terms:

  Sample rate — it declares 96 kHz but its spectral content stops at, or
    just above, the ~22.05 kHz Nyquist limit of a 44.1 kHz source. That
    sharp cutoff is the fingerprint of upsampling: taking a CD-quality or
    lossy source and re-encoding it at a higher rate without adding any
    real high-frequency content. Measuring it is a heuristic.

  Bit depth — it declares 24-bit but only 16 of those bits ever carry
    data, the low 8 being zero in every single sample. That is a CD master
    padded out to look deeper, and unlike the spectral test this one is
    exact: bits are either used or they are not. It is also the only test
    that says anything about a 24-bit/44.1 kHz file, which claims Hi-Res
    purely by depth and which the spectral test cannot judge at all.

This is a best-effort heuristic, not a certification, and the thing it
measures cannot distinguish between the two ways a spectrum ends at 22 kHz:
an upsampled CD, and a genuine hi-res master that was deliberately low-pass
filtered during mastering (not rare in pop/rock). Both read as "fake_hires"
here, because in the signal they are the same. Treat the verdict as a hint
worth a closer listen, not proof — and note that acting on it automatically
(SpotiFLAC's --redownload-fake-hires) will replace such a master with a
LOSSLESS copy, which costs its bit depth even though no audible content is
lost.

            leaves a transition-band tail a couple of kHz wide, which a

            measured 44.1 -> 176.4 kHz upsample of a commercial track
