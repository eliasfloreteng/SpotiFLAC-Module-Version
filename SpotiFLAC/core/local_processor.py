"""SpotiFLAC/core/local_processor.py — Phase 3: Safe Tagger, plus the
orchestration glue used by the GUI/web
"Fix Local Files" tab.

Tag-writing itself is NOT reimplemented here — tagger.embed_metadata_async()
already accepts an arbitrary pre-existing file_path and already strips old
tags before writing new ones (see tagger._embed_flac / _embed_id3, both call
audio.delete() first). What this module adds on top:
  - a temporary .bak backup before overwriting, restored automatically if
    anything goes wrong partway through
  - MusicBrainz enrichment by ISRC (genre, MBIDs, barcode, label, ...),
    merged into EmbedOptions.extra_tags right before the write — see
    _with_musicbrainz_tags()
  - tying local_scanner (Phase 1) + local_matcher (Phase 2) + the tagger
    together into the "scan a folder, decide what to do with each file"
    workflows used by the CLI and the API layer
