"""Recent-fetches history — what was looked up, most recent first.

Backed by `core/db.py` rather than by rewriting `recent-fetches.json` on
every add. The file was capped at 50 entries not because 50 is a useful
number but because the whole list was re-serialised each time a track was
fetched; a table has no such reason to forget, so the cap is now an
order-of-magnitude larger and exists only to keep the GUI's "recent" list
from growing without end.

The legacy JSON file is imported exactly once — the fact that it has been
is recorded in the database, not inferred from the table being empty — and
then left alone (`cache_admin` still knows how to prune it). Nothing is lost
on upgrade and nothing has to be migrated by hand.

Note this is *lookup* history, not a record of downloads — see
`core/download_log.py` for that, which is a different question with a
different lifetime.
