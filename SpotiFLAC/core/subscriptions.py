"""core/subscriptions.py — following an artist, and fetching only what's new.

`--watch` re-syncs one URL on a timer. That is the right tool for a playlist
you keep pointed at, and the wrong one for an artist: a discography URL
re-resolves the entire back catalogue every pass, and the only reason it
doesn't re-download it is that every provider skips a file already on disk.
Nothing anywhere remembers "I have already seen this release", so nothing can
answer the question people actually have — *what came out since last time?*

That memory is all this module adds. A subscription is a URL plus a set of
release ids already seen; checking it lists the artist's releases, subtracts
the ones on record, and hands back the remainder. The download itself is
still `SpotiflacDownloader`, called with the new releases' own URLs — this
module never downloads anything, which is what keeps it testable without a
network or an installed provider.

The first check
---------------
A brand-new subscription does **not** download the back catalogue. It records
what exists today as already-seen and returns nothing, so the first thing it
ever fetches is the first thing released after you subscribed. That is what
"follow an artist" means to almost everybody, and the alternative — typing
one command and being handed four hundred tracks — is a bad surprise to
inflict by default. `backfill=True` (CLI: `--subscribe-backfill`) opts into
the other reading.

Playlists
---------
A playlist URL makes a `kind="playlist"` subscription: the seen-set holds
track ids instead of release ids, and a check hands back the tracks added
since the last one — with their metadata, so they can be queued for download
without a second lookup each. The same first-check rule applies: the tracks
already in the playlist are the baseline.

Checking on a timer
-------------------
`interval_minutes` > 0 puts a subscription on the scheduler
(core/subscription_scheduler.py), which checks it whenever that much time has
passed since its last check and downloads what is new with the settings saved
in `download_config`. 0 leaves it to the manual "check" buttons.

Storage is `core/db.py`: the seen-set is append-mostly and unbounded, which
is the shape a rewrite-the-whole-file JSON store handles worst.
