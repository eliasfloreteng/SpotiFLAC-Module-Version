"""output_sink.py — One switchable destination for everything a run prints.

Every human-readable line a download produces goes out through one of three
doors: ``core/console`` (the run header, per-track lines, the summary
banner), ``safe_print``/``safe_tqdm_write`` in ``core/progress`` (the
downloader's own asides), and the logging handler installed by
``install_console_interception``. All three write straight to stdout/stderr
via ``tqdm.write``, which is exactly right for a terminal and exactly wrong
for a full-screen UI: a single stray line lands in the middle of someone
else's layout and the frame is torn until the next full redraw.

So instead of teaching each call site about the caller, they all funnel
through :func:`emit`, which asks one module-level question — is a sink
installed? — and either hands the line to the sink or falls through to the
current ``tqdm.write`` behaviour. With no sink installed nothing changes for
the CLI, which is the point: this module is meant to be invisible until
something claims the screen.

Installing a sink also switches off the tqdm bars (see
``progress_bars_enabled``), because a bar is a stream of carriage returns
aimed at a terminal the sink's owner is now drawing on.

Typical use, from a UI that owns the screen::

    with output_sink(lambda line, stream: log_widget.write(line)):
        await run_download(...)
